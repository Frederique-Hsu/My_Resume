        Developed the 1st domestic laparoscopic surgical robot: Toumai.  I took part in the development of 4 core modules as below:
        This system adopts the PLC ST(another kind of OOP language, but it features the hardware real-time as PLC) \qquad{}

        and C++ hybrid programming, based on Beckhoff TwinCAT platform, we've achieved the 
        real-time manipulation from the master 2 arms on the surgeon cart to the slave 4 arms on the patient cart.
        
        \faCaretRight{}\quad{} Besides the development, we have collaborated with the surgeons from Shanghai Changhai hospital and SAHZU hospital to carry out the 
        pancreatectomy, radical prostatectomy and hysteromyomectomy experiments on pigs and corpses, in order to validate its clinical 
        applicability. 
        
        \faCaretRight{}\quad{} Toumai finally passed the model certificate of NMPA on Jan. 27, 2022, as the sole domestic surgical robot.

        Developed the software system of Toumai surgical robot patient cart independently, I had adopted Qt QML to render the fancy and surgeon-
        friendly HMI, designed a well-organized architecture with 4-hierarchical layers: ControlUI---HMI logic---ADS Comm.---MotionCtrl, plus one 
        independent Error Management module.
        
        \faCaretRight{}\quad{} I also proposed/implemented the innovative real-time mapping mechanism between State-Machine on driver layer and Mirror-State-Machine on 
        UI application layer. This state-of-the-art software architecture realized the real-time response/control effect on both hardware and 
        software. 
        
        \faCaretRight{}\quad{} I used Qt QML/C++/Windows Driver hybrid programming to develop the software system.

                Developed a comprehensive software platform and management suite in C\# and C++:
                \href{https://github.com/Frederique-Hsu/AUPS}{AUPS (Augmented Universal Platform \& Sequenzer)}
                
                It builds an integrated platform to support general-purpose automatic function testing, manages
                and executes the testing flow for communication electronic product. It also offers engineers the
                2nd development for customization capability (This project had opened in GitHub.)
                
                \faCaretRight\quad{}AUPS utilizes the sequence.xml test script to save and organize test items, manages
                their automation flow, provides the graphical editor to allow editing items and parameters by engineers themself.
                
                \faCaretRight\quad{}Design an uniform UI to monitor the automatic testing process.
                
                \faCaretRight\quad{}AUPS achieved up to 16 sessions running in parallel, multiple instruments can be connected together
                over the ethernet, to compose the auto-testing production line, AUPS facilitated to improve automation dramatically.

                Designed the NFC data link equipment for programming firmware image to \faApple{} iPhone 8 \& X smart phones in the 
                contactless way. 
                
                We had applied a patent for this equipment: One kind of NFC data transferring device with ultra-large capability.
